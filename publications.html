        This paper presents our self-supervised deep learning approach for image restoration specifically designed for 
        x-ray computed laminographic tomography. The method eliminates the need for paired training data by leveraging 
        the inherent structure of the imaging problem, achieving significant improvements in image quality for 
        laminographic applications.
